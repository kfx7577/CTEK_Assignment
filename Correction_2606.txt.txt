Correction made:
- Replaced integers a and b into dynamic integer arrays; a and b, both with size N + 1
- Separated calc_min_cap function into two steps:
	1) Extract vector of pairs into dynamic arrays a and b
	2) Run calculation of number of passengers with extracted a and b,
	   computing minimum capacity of bus
- Ensure that the index i, representing the i-th stop, starts from 1 to N

where
N = Size of the vector of pairs.
